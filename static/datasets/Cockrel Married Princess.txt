How the cockerel married the princess

Once upon a time, a king of a town wanted to give out his daughter named Arademi out in marriage. He ordered the town crier to announce to the town's people that whosoever desired to marry his daughter should come and see him in the palace after three days. On the third day those that wanted to marry the princess had all gathered in the palace. Afterwards, the king told them what needed to be done before anyone of them could marry his daughter. He told them that whoever wanted to marry Arademi must prepare to cultivate a yam plantation for him, and he promised that whosoever that first finished the yam plantation will marry the princess.

On the day appointed for the would be lovers to show up, it was very few people that came out that they would be able to do the work. They were Kannakanna, Awoko and Cockerel. The king went to hide Arademi in a village close to where the farm was to be located that whoever finished the work first will be able to marry her.

Awoko and Kannakanna woke up very early and went to the farm to go and start the work. Cockerel, the third person had slept off. As he woke up, he took his hoe and went to king's farm. As he was going, he was singing saying:
		Narrator:  Arademi Arademi
		Audience:  Arademi
		Narrator:  Arademi  Arademi
		Audience:  Arademi
		Narrator: Kannakanna has got to the farm
		Audience:  Arade
		Narrator:  Awoko  has got to the river
		Audience:  Arade
		Narrator: I cockerel has not come
		Audience:  Arade 
		Narrator: I cockerel has not woken up
		Audience:  Arade

Before Cockerel got to the farm, his counterparts had worked so much. Quickly he started to work as well, he overtook them that have started before him and left them behind. When Awoko and Kannakanna saw that he has left them behind, they started to cast spell on the cockerel, immediately the cockerel's hoe tore apart. Cockerel ran home and went to take another hoe and he was singing as he was doing before, saying:
		Narrator:  Arademi  Arademi
		Audience:  Arademi
		Narrator:  Arademi  Arademi
		Audience:  Arade
		Narrator: Kannakanna has got to the farm
		Audience:  Arade
		Narrator:  Awoko  has got to the river
		Audience:  Arade
		Narrator: I cockerel has not come
		Audience:  Arade
		Narrator: I cockerel has not woken up
		Audience:  Arade

As soon as he came back to the farm, he continued with his work, he again overtook the two of them. As they saw that cockerel had overtaken them as before, they started to cast spell on him and the cockerel's hoe tore apart again. What would cockerel do? He ran home the second time and went to take another hoe. As he was coming back, he met an old woman on his way. He narrated his ordeal to the old woman, the woman offered to help him. She taught him that when Awoko and Kannakanna were casting their spell to tear apart his hoe, that cockerel should reply and say 'stick strong as the cobweb'.

When the cockerel got to the farm, he was working very hard and overtook his competitors as usual. As they saw that he had overtaken them again, they said tear apart cockerel replied and said 'stick strong as the cobweb' and his hoe didn't tear again. As a result of this, the cockerel got to the neighboring village first where the princess called  Arademi was hidden and he married her.
The story taught us that no matter how much difficulty we face in life, if 
we live our lives with integrity, joy will surely come after all the difficulties.
