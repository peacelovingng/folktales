Olailo and The Forest Spirit.

My story is centered on a man called Olailo who was a farmer and one spirit who was from a place close to heaven.

In the olden days, it was a tradition for the spirits to transform into human beings if they have a special job to do in their village or they wanted to go and buy something in the town where humans are living. One time, some spirits who were staying close to heaven wanted to come and beautify their village, because of this they went to buy  hoe and other things that they will need to weed their village. One of the spirits that were sent transformed into a very beautiful woman and branched unto one man called Olailo.

When this woman got to Olailo, she greeted him very well and asked him how much he was selling his hoe. Olailo answered and said it was one shilling; the woman pleaded with Olailo to collect one cent, he was not supposed to sell the hoe at the rate of one cent but because of the woman’s beauty, he asked her to pay. As the woman paid, and she wanted to start going, Olailo beckoned to her that he would like to know her home. The woman explained to Olailo that no human can get to her home because it was very far, but as frightening as it sounded, Olailo did not entertain any fear at all because he could fight more than every other person in the entire town, and that he was so sure that anything that would arise couldn’t be more than fight fight would settle it. That woman also liked Olailo because he was a handsome man, but she knew quite alright that Olailo could not live with a spirit like her.

In a nutshell, Olailo did not listen to all the explanation that the woman gave him; he packed his wares and followed her. When they have walked a little the woman started to sing like this saying:
		Narrator: Blacksmith depart from me
		Audience: Get back Blacksmith get back
		Narrator: If you don’t get back you will get to a river of dye
		Audience: Get back Blacksmith get back
		Narrator: If you don’t get back you will get to a river of blood
		Audience: Get back Blacksmith get back
		Narrator: Blacksmith depart from me
		Audience: Get back Blacksmith get back

Truly the song entered Olailo’s ears but he could not go back because of the beauty of the spirit. After some time they got to the river of dye. The river was so black like dye, all the trees and plants around the river were black as well. It was a strange river. What really confirmed the river to be a strange one was that everywhere was very quiet and that immediately they got there a canoe came from the other side of the river to come and meet them without anyone paddling it. As they entered the canoe, it started to move on its own accord and took them to the other side of the river.

After they had left the river of dye and walked a little, Olailo’s mother that had died turned to a wind and appeared to his son. She pleaded unto him to get back but Olailo refused. Lastly she gave him slippers to wear across the River of blood. After Olailo and the spirit had walked for a long time and were getting close to the river of blood, she started to sing saying: 
		Narrator: Blacksmith depart from me 
		Audience: Get back Blacksmith get back  
		Narrator: If you don’t get back you will get to a river of dye 
		Audience: Get back Blacksmith get back 
		Narrator: If you don’t get back you will get to a river of blood 
		Audience: Get back Blacksmith get back 
		Narrator: Blacksmith depart from me 
		Audience: Get back Blacksmith get back

When they have walked for long time, they got to the river of blood where all the plants and trees and everything around were red like blood. The river was so  dangerous, because instead of the canoe that took them at the river of  dye; it was a long tiny metal that was on the river which one needed to  step on to move across the river. As they got to the river the spirit woman wore her slippers, Olailo also wore the ones his mother gave to him quickly. As the woman stepped on the bridge with her slippers, Olailo also followed her; he was surprised as his feet lifted themselves without lifting them within a second they were across the river.

Immediately they were across the river, they started seeing strange things. This experience made Olailo to be a little frightened but because he was so sure of his fighting skills he was not afraid. Lastly they got close to the heaven’s gate where Olailo saw different human head that were hanged on the tree left and right, before Olailo knew what was happenning the pretty woman entered a very big compound that was completely fenced round and transformed herself to a spirit with one eye.

Olailo thought of what he could do and entered the big fenced compound also but when he got there he saw several spirits going and coming. One may have eyes on the head; another may have his eyes on the chest. Several of them have one leg, and some have more than one head. As soon as they saw Olailo they were very happy, because they thought food has come for them.

The leader of the spirits who has ten heads was the first to speak and said “you human there is no safety for anyone that come into our own town here, because of this prepare to die”. When Olailo heard this he was afraid and begged them that they should please allow him to go, that it was because he didn’t know. The leader of the spirits did not listen to Olailo’s plea but he told him that, if he could fight with some spirits and defeat them, he would allow him to go in peace. There was no other alternative for Olailo, because of this he agreed to fight with the spirits. He thought he was a powerful man.

The spirit with one head was the first to fight with Olailo and it was not long before Olailo defeated him. After that, Olailo defeated the spirit with two heads, three heads, and four heads. The rest spirits realized that Olailo was full of strength because of this they prepared for him very well. Not quite long, it was the turn of the spirit with five heads; Olailo defeated him with all his strength. The spirit with six heads came out to the fighting arena and shook Olailo but at the end Olailo defeated him with annoyance. Later, the spirit with seven heads fought with Olailo, the spirit was so cruel but Olailo made him sleep. That was how he fought with all of them till the turn of the spirit with ten heads.

After the death of the spirit with nine heads, the spirit with ten heads came out and fought with Olailo. As at that time Olailo was very tired, he didn’t have strength to fight again because of this the spirit with ten heads defeated Olailo and killed him. The spirit with ten heads entered the bush that was to where he was, he plucked a leaf and squeezed the water in the leaf into the eyes of all spirits that have died and they all woke up. When the spirits woke up the spirit with ten heads sent them to go and look for firewood that they would use to cook Olailo. Immediately they all left, Olailo’s mother that had turned to a housefly on a particular tree while they were fighting transformed herself and took the remaining leaf that the spirit with ten heads used, she squeezed the water into Olailo’s eyes and he woke up.

Without wasting much time, Olailo’s mother pulled Olailo and they were running away. They ran till they got to the bank of river of blood. When they got there, Olailo’s mother turned to a big bird and carried Olailo across the river. Olailo had lost his slippers at the wrestling arena. When they got to the river of dye, they cross over through the canoe. Olailo’s mother followed him a little while and then went her way.

Olailo faced the way to his town with tears in his eyes because he was missing his mother. After some time, Olailo entered the town, crowd gathered round him asking him where he had been for a few days that he didn’t come to sell fine hoes to them.  Olailo did not hesitate to explain all that happened to him.

Since that time, humans were very reluctant to marry women that are too beautiful because they might be strange beings or animals that have transformed themselves to become humans. Finally, the story taught us that we should consult with people before we take any step and that we should take advice from elders.

That was where I got to and I went back.
