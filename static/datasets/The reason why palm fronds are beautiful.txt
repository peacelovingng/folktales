 The Reason Why Palm Fronds are Beautiful.

Once upon a time, there was a lady who was very beautiful. The lady was neither too short nor too tall, she was neither too dark in complexion nor too fair in complexion. She was a little bit light in complexion. Her teeth were as white like cattle egrets; her eye lashes were as dark like coal. She was a beauty to behold. She was so beautiful that almost all men were asking for her hand in marriage. Humans could get married to animals and trees at the time. As human were coming to ask for the hand of the lady in marriage, animals and trees were also coming for her. King of the town wanted to marry the lady, but she refused to marry the king, chiefs, rich men all tried to marry the lady but she refused to marry anyone of them.

After some time different type of trees were coming to marry the lady. Iroko, oganwo, odan came, also different popular animals like elephant, tiger and so on came to marry the lady but she refused to marry them. At the end, palm tree told the other trees that he would also try his luck. The other trees were making jest of him saying; "you also, you that looked so ugly, we that were more handsome could not marry the lady". But palm tree braced up like a man and went to go and meet the beautiful lady. When he was about to get to where the lady was, he started to praise himself with a song saying:
		Narrator: 	'Egunmo' answer
		Audience: 	'Egunmo' please please, 'Egunmo'
		Narrator: 	'It's me palm tree calling'
		Audience: 	'Egunmo' please please, 'Egunmo' 
		Narrator: 	'I came to marry you'
		Audience: 	'Egunmo' please please, 'Egunmo'
		Narrator: 	With calabash full of money
		Audience: 	'Egunmo' please please, 'Egunmo'
		Narrator: 	With  cockerel.
		Audience: 	'Egunmo' please please, 'Egunmo'

Palm tree sang the song three times before the beautiful lady called Egunmo could answer him. By the time she would answer him, she answered with a question saying: 
		Narrator: 	What have you brought for me to marry you?
		Audience: 	'Egunmo' please please, 'Egunmo'

By the time palm tree listed all he had brought to marry the lady, the lady refused to marry him. Palm tree sang as he had sang before and added other things saying:
		Narrator: 	Dont you remember the palm wine on me
		Audience: 	'Egunmo' please please, 'Egunmo'
		Narrator: 	Dont you remember the palm fruit on me
		Audience: 	'Egunmo' please please, 'Egunmo' 
		Narrator: 	Don't you remember the broom on me
		Audience: 	'Egunmo' please please, 'Egunmo'
		Narrator: 	Don't you remember the palm fronds on me
		Audience: 	'Egunmo' please please, 'Egunmo'
		Narrator: 	Don't you remember the palm oil on me
		Audience: 	'Egunmo' please please, 'Egunmo'
		Narrator: 	Don't you remember the palm kernel on me
		Audience: 	'Egunmo' please please, 'Egunmo'
		Narrator: 	Don't you remember the palm kernel oil on me
		Audience: 	'Egunmo' please please, 'Egunmo'

Palm tree praised himself with all that human could found on him. 'Egunmo was thoughtful about the song sung by palm tree; she realized that a woman could not do without making use of one or two of the material from palm tree daily. Therefore, she agreed to marry the palm tree. Palm tree bent down and asked her to sit in the middle of his head. That was how 'Egunmo' sat on palm tree's head; she became the most beautiful palm frond on the palm tree till today.
